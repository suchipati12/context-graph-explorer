# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function from input variables to output variables. Common algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Key techniques include:
- Clustering (K-means, Hierarchical)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- Association Rules

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

## Key Concepts

### Data Preprocessing
Before training any model, data must be cleaned and prepared:
- Data cleaning removes errors and inconsistencies
- Feature scaling normalizes different measurement units
- Feature selection identifies the most relevant variables

### Model Training
The process of teaching an algorithm to make predictions:
1. Split data into training and testing sets
2. Choose appropriate algorithm
3. Train the model on training data
4. Evaluate performance on test data

### Overfitting and Underfitting
- Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise
- Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture underlying patterns
- Cross-validation helps detect these issues

## Applications

Machine learning has numerous real-world applications:
- **Healthcare**: Disease diagnosis, drug discovery
- **Finance**: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading
- **Technology**: Recommendation systems, natural language processing
- **Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles, route optimization

## Conclusion

Machine learning is a powerful tool that continues to transform industries and create new possibilities for solving complex problems. Understanding its fundamentals is essential for anyone working in data science or artificial intelligence.
